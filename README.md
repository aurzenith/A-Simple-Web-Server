# A-Simple-Web-Server
This a simple web server I created over the summer of 2025 and updated as of September 2025.

## Outline
It is able to bind to a socket, fill IPs using the getaddr_in() function, and read and respond to HTTP requests (only GET as of now).

It also has an HTML "parser" which can take an HTML file in and display the contents to a web browser.
