# A-Simple-Web-Server
This a simple web server some others and I have decided to program over the summer of 2025

## Outline
A web server that can bind to a socket. It will be a able to read and respond to HTTP requests.

It will be able to display HTML/CSS content too. Will add a test somewhere in here
